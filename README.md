# MyBuddy - A Microsoft Agent Interface

This is a custom Microsoft Agent software. You can select an Agent Character [here](https://bellcraft.com/mash/chars.aspx) or use Pikachu, which is included. You'll have to update the path to align with your own directory. 

Currently, MyBuddy can perform the following services:
- Notify you of e-mails
- Send e-mails (Must set up UserSecrets file, with your username and password, and update host servers to your e-mail provider's)
- Speak whatever you type for him
- Open some programs within the interface window

Things I'm planning to add (accepting suggestions):
- Further e-mail integration
- Interact with news feeds (RSS feed or tweets)
- Search capabilities, answer questions (similar to Google assistant or Alexa)
- Play media (spotify, local files, etc.)
- Timer/Reminders
- Edit Windows Settings
- Adding a custom Bobby Hill Agent Character (will include deep learning to comment on things on screen and talk with and hopefully a custom text to speech voice)

This has been such a frustrating project, but I'm learning a lot and it's fun to work on making the original digital assistant much more helpful. I grew up on Windows 95, 98, 2000, so I'm a big fan of the classic Windows tools and styles.
